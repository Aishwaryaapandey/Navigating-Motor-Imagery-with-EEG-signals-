# Navigating-Motor-Imagery-with-EEG-signals-
This project classifies and clusters EEG motor imagery data using preprocessing, ICA, CSP, SVM, XGBoost, DBSCAN, and K-means, with accuracy and Silhouette scores for evaluation.

# Abstract

Motor imagery, a cognitive process involving the mental simulation of movement without physical action, is analyzed in this project. The study focuses on extracting and preprocessing EEG signals and using machine learning models to classify and cluster these signals for potential applications in Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) systems.

# Introduction

In this project, we work with EEG signal data, applying various methods to prepare, clean, and remove noise, which is common in real-world data. Key features are then extracted and fed into multiple machine learning algorithms for classification and clustering. The results are subsequently analyzed to determine the effectiveness of each approach.

# Dataset

This project uses EEG data provided by the **Berlin BCI group**.

# Preprocessing
We applied several preprocessing techniques to improve signal quality:

Bandpass Filtering,
Common Average Referencing (CAR),
Laplacian Filtering,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
Normalization


# Feature Extraction
For feature extraction, the following methods were utilized:

Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and 
Common Spatial Patterns (CSP)

# *Classification and Clustering are in process*
